In this project, I involved in creating a prototype system using HTML and JavaScript programming languages for the development of a countdown system for unloading lot which is also my internship project. This project is proposed by my internship supervisor in hope of addressing the issue of wrong info printed on the wafer lots at the production. Therefore, a countdown timer record system is proposed to avoid such incident from happening again.

# Methodology
Briefly, the methodology of the project is as follows:
1. *(Optional)* Login to the system for admins.
2. Fill in details
3. Click “Submit” button
4. Once message prompt “Expired”, marking process is complete

There are three important components of the system: user login interface, countdown timer interface before and after submission.

# Results and Discussion

From this project, engineering knowledge are implemented to resolve the company’s core problem. Root cause analysis such as fishbone diagram are used to find the causes and suitable solutions. The system is successfully designed using HTML and JavaScript programming language. The countdown timer helps to improve quality of marking process. Automated system ensures integrity of lot history as the operators can check the timestamp of start and end of marking process. The system also improves productivity of the employees. Since manual logbook are prone to human errors, the employees can focus now more on important tasks.
